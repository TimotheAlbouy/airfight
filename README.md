# Airfight, by TimothÃ© Albouy and Youssef El Hor

Qt game realized during advanced OOP course of the ENSIBS.

## Requirements

This project requires Qt >=5 as well as the `core`, `gui` and `multimedia` modules. It also requires a C++ >= 11 compiler.

To get the full experience, it is preferable to play Airfight on a screen able to display a 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels window. If your screen is to small, you can change the size of the window by editing the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` constant attributes of the `Game` class in `game.h`.
